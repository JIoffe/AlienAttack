# Alien Attack
## Retro-inspired FPS

This is an homage to games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D - an in-browser first person shooter where you have to save the day from aliens and monsters!

This utilizes the Buld engine map format. The rendering code itself is custom, as is any of the assets.

Please do not redistribute the code outside of this repo.
